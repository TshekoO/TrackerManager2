Debug_Notes

1. buggy_frontend.ts Fixed 

Problem Identified 
The problem was that the TypeScript file had import statements for Angular modules e.g @angular/core and @angular/common/http but the packages were not installed in the project without these packages the project wouldn't have run


How it was Fixed 

I fixed the problem by installing the required Angular packages using npm install @angular/core @angular/common

2. buggy_frontend.ts Fixed 


Problem Identified 

In CompleteTask, you do not check if task is null before setting task.Completed = true; This will throw a NullReferenceException if the task is not found then API crashes 

How it was Fixed 

I solved the problem by adding a null check(if statement) for the task object in the CompleteTask method, this prevents the exception and provides a proper API response.
