1.Explain the difference between an API integration error and a logic error.

An API integration error happens when the application is unable to effectively interface with an external system, and a logic error is a design flaw in the software that leads to inaccurate output.

2. What steps would you take to troubleshoot a non-responsive API call?

    Make sure that the network connection and endpoint URL are correct.
    Verify that the API server can be reached online.
    Verify that API keys or authentication tokens are legitimate.
    For potential issues, check the server logs.
    Check the data payload and request headers.

3. Why is it important to separate frontend and backend responsibilities?

Keeping front-end and back-end tasks distinct helps to manage development. The codebase is easier to maintain, debugging is made simpler and UI and server logic can operate separately.

4. Name a testing framework or tool you have used or researched and describe its purpose.

I looked into Jest, a testing tool for JavaScript that is used to simulate modules, perform unit tests, and verify that code operates as intended.

5. How do you ensure your code remains maintainable over time?

I ensure that I write readable, understandable code and reworking if necessary to ensure that everything is maintained.
